These are test generators for testing stompy. Try 'make test' to
generate *.out files that are then fed to ../stompy -R. The
following PRNGs are currently evaluated:

  - lcg-rand  - a vulnerable standard C library LCG (rand()) that
                should fail the tests; note that on most modern
                GNU lib versions, this might be aliased to LFSR.

  - lfsr-rand - linear feedback shift register, very good
                properties, but susceptible to cryptanalysis 
                (passes for now, shouldn't in the future).

  - mtwister  - Mersenne Twister, a competent but not necessarily
                cryptographically secure generator that has a
                high order of dimensional equidistribution (should
                pass),

  - urandom   - a cryptographically secure MD5-based PRNG on Linux
                (or Schneier's Yarrow on FreeBSD) - should pass.
